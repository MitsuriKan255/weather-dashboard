## Features

- Search weather by city name.
- Display current temperature and weather conditions.
- Metric units and a clean responsive interface.
- Loading and error states for missing keys, unknown cities, and API failures.
- URL encoding for city names and basic validation of API responses.
- Fast local development and production builds with Vite.

## Tech stack

- React 18
- Vite 6
- Modern JavaScript modules
- OpenWeatherMap Current Weather API
- Plain CSS

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm
- An OpenWeatherMap API key

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MitNak25/weather-dashboard.git
cd weather-dashboard
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set your key:

```env
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_key
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite, normally `http://localhost:5173`.

## Available commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the development server with hot reload. |
| `npm run build` | Create the optimized production build in `dist/`. |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally. |

## Security note

Vite exposes variables prefixed with `VITE_` to browser code. The weather API key is therefore public in the built application. Restrict the key by domain or usage in OpenWeatherMap, and use a backend proxy with server-side secrets if the application requires stronger protection.

Never commit `.env`; use `.env.example` as the configuration template.

## Continuous integration

GitHub Actions runs on pushes and pull requests to `main` and verifies that dependencies install and the application builds successfully. See [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
